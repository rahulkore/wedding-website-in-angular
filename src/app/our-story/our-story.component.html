                                        That first meet you were just a stranger and today I wish to spend my whole life with you.. I fall for you more, every single time I see you.. 

The shopping trips we made.. those engaging talks.. crazy laughs.. momos and tandoori filled lanes.. rushing for the locals.. office talks.. there have been so many memories in the past few months.. besides all, the epic train journey will always be at the top of my list, the day I knew I found my soulmate! 

Hehheh I am surprised to see this me, being so excited and hopeful about everything. Thanks for always showing me better vision and choices one can have.. Thanks for seeing right in an imperfect person Tanhi. 

Being with you makes me complete. I would choose you again and again.. bessed to have you my strong and adorable Ironman.. You are Special ðŸ’œ

                                        Before meeting you I was mentally prepared to find reasons to reject you and get it over with. I am glad that you disappointed me by not giving me a single reason. The more I got to know you, I realized you are the ideal guy for me - you are smart, understanding, tall enough, sweet, an amazing cook, very patient, good looking with a really high tolerance level xD . What started with me trying to find reasons for rejecting you or getting you to reject me ended up with us falling for each other. I love how you embraced all my weird quirks and my sincere love for BTS and a few others ( which even my mom hasn't been able to accept yet xD) . The past few months have been amazing with a lot of ups and a few downs as well but I love them all. You are truly the best and thank you for being with me but I will always be Ironman and you Pepper Potts. It has been great knowing you and troubling you so far and I intent to continue doing so for a very very long time. I wish you all the best for the same lmao.
